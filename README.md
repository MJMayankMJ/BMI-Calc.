# BMI Calculator App

Welcome to the BMI Calculator App! This application is built using SwiftUI, following the MVVM architecture pattern, and integrates [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata) for local data storage and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication and cloud data management.

## Features

- **Calculate BMI**: Input your height and weight to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI).
- **User Authentication**: Sign in and register using [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).
- **Profile Management**: Store and manage user profiles using [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata).
- **Responsive UI**: Built with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) for a seamless user experience across all iOS devices.

## Architecture

This app is structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns and facilitates easier testing and maintenance.

- **Model**: Represents the data structures and business logic.
- **View**: [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) views that display the UI.
- **ViewModel**: Handles the presentation logic and acts as a bridge between the Model and the View.

## Technologies

- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface.
- **Core Data**: For local data persistence.
- **Firebase**: For authentication and cloud data storage.

## Usage

1. **Login/Register**: Use the login or register screen to authenticate using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
2. **Calculate BMI**: Enter your height and weight to calculate your BMI.
3. **View Profiles**: Manage your profile information stored locally using [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata).
